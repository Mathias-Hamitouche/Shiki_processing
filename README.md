Shiki Processing is made for an intermediate post-processing step for LC-MS /GC-MS data processing using MZmine.

**What Shiki Processings does :** 

- Atom counting of chemicals formulas determined using MZmine chemical formula determination module
- Calculation O/C and H/C ratios in order to build Van-Krevelen diagrams later on with the diagram builder of your choice
- Cleaning up the CSV of all unnecessary columns accumulated through the Batch mode process
- Deleting all features which has undetermined chemical formulas.

This script is my first python script I have ever made so feedbacks are heavily appreciated !
